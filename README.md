🎨 React Mood-Based UI App
A dynamic and intelligent web app that changes theme, layout, and content based on the user’s mood — detected manually or through AI-powered facial expression recognition using a webcam.

✅ Manual mood selection (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Love)
✅ AI Mood Detection using webcam (via face-api.js)
✅ Dynamic theming using Tailwind CSS
✅ Mood-based content: quotes + emojis
✅ Toggle between Manual and AI Detection modes
✅ Clean, responsive UI built with React + Vite
